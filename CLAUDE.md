# Spanish Spelling Bee Study Guide — 2026 NSSB

## Project Overview

Interactive study app for the **National Spanish Spelling Bee 2026** (July 10-11, Albuquerque, NM). Helps students in grades 4-8 practice the most difficult words from the official competition word list.

Built with **Vite + React** (single-file app in `src/App.jsx`). No external UI libraries — all styling is inline.

## Architecture

- **Single component file**: `src/App.jsx` contains everything — data, components, routing, and styles
- **No router**: Mode switching via `useState("menu")` in the root `App` component
- **No state management library**: All state is local React hooks
- **Speech**: Uses the Web Speech API (`SpeechSynthesisUtterance`) with Spanish voice (es-MX preferred)
- **No backend**: Fully static, deployed to Netlify via drag-and-drop of `dist/`

## Current Word Data

76 difficult words organized into 6 categories in the `CATEGORIES` object:

| Category | Count | Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| Silent H | 17 | Words with silent 'h' (aherrumbrar, deshuesar) |
| Accents & Tildes | 15 | Accent placement (esdrújulas, agudas) |
| Double Letters | 13 | cc, rr, ll, nn combinations |
| B vs V | 11 | Homophones in Spanish (b/v sound identical) |
| Diéresis (ü) | 7 | güe/güi words requiring ü |
| Tricky Combinations | 12 | Unusual clusters (lfh, sc, x-) |

Each word has: `word`, `def` (English definition), `tip` (spelling-specific hint).

The full official word list has **1,000+ words** across all difficulty levels (source PDF: "2026 National Spanish Spelling Bee Booklet", pages 10-24).

## Study Modes

1. **Listen & Spell** (competition style) — Word is read aloud, student types it without seeing it. Has Repeat, Slow, Definition, and In Context buttons mimicking what students can request during the real competition. Includes accent character toolbar (á é í ó ú ü ñ).

2. **Multiple Choice Quiz** — Pick the correct spelling from 4 options. Misspellings are auto-generated by: removing accents, swapping b/v, dropping silent h, removing double letters, removing diéresis.

3. **Type to Spell** — Like Listen & Spell but with the definition and spelling tip visible.

4. **Study Flashcards** — Browse by category with toggle for definition, spelling tip, and audio playback.

## Key Functions

- `useSpanishVoice()` — Custom hook that finds the best Spanish voice and returns a `speak(text, rate)` function
- `shuffleArray(arr)` — Fisher-Yates shuffle for randomizing word order
- `generateMisspellings(word)` — Creates plausible wrong spellings based on common Spanish spelling errors

## Competition Rules (for feature context)

- Students hear the word, can ask for: repetition, definition, use in a sentence, part of speech
- 3-minute time limit per word
- Must include all diacritical marks: accents (´), tilde (ñ), diéresis (ü)
- Must clarify: b/v distinction, r/rr, ll, ch, ñ, capitals (mayúscula)
- Whiteboard allowed for visualization during competition

## Build & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server at localhost:5173
npm run build    # production build to dist/
```

## Deploy

```bash
npm run build
# Drag dist/ folder to https://app.netlify.com/drop
```

## Feature Ideas

### High Priority
- **Add all 1,000+ words** from the official list (currently only 76 hardest)
- **Difficulty levels** (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced) so younger students aren't overwhelmed
- **Progress persistence** with localStorage — track which words have been mastered vs. need review
- **Spaced repetition** — show missed words more frequently
- **Missed words review** — after a quiz, option to replay only the ones you got wrong

### Medium Priority
- **Part of speech** data for each word (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) — students can request this in the real bee
- **Language of origin** (Latin, Greek, Arabic, etc.) — also requestable in competition
- **Sentence examples** in Spanish for the "use in a sentence" competition feature
- **Timer mode** — 3-minute countdown per word matching real competition rules
- **Whiteboard mode** — drawing canvas for students who want to visualize before committing

### Nice to Have
- **Parent/teacher dashboard** — see student progress over time
- **Head-to-head mode** — two students compete on same device
- **Print-friendly word lists** by category for offline study
- **PWA support** — installable app with offline capability
- **Dark mode**
